in total war, primary missle weapon has alt_celctic_javelin_precursor, and the other doesnt have th precursor, what doe sit mean?


ChatGPT said:
In Total War, when a primary missile weapon has alt_celtic_javelin_precursor (or any _precursor variant), it means:

That missile is thrown before engaging in melee.

Key Behavior:
Precursor javelins are thrown automatically when the unit charges or is charged.

Non-precursor javelins require manual activation in ranged stance.

Only one volley is thrown with precursor weapons.

Used mainly by heavy infantry like Roman principes or Celtic warriors to soften up enemies before contact.

Without precursor, the unit won't auto-throw on charge — you'd need to micro them to skirmish or stay ranged.
